# Phone Controller
This is a phone controller design inspired by the 3ds.
You can view and download the 3d model [here](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/3e0c9ef397f91415fa372e0c/w/6f6e95703b5b2ee9676d2bfe/e/8a00a41f1ee7d469ca8e343f?renderMode=0&uiState=69529d2b1ac4d36407fdba0f)

On this github, you will find the pcb source files & gerbers and the code that needs to be loaded to the controller.
